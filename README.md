# lyracity
 merged Lyra and City Sample for UE 5.3
 
 1.Lyra bots and gameplay working
 
 2.vehicles and Crowd working
 
 3.packaging game working

download this repo and unpack

you need to copy content of Lyra Sample Content folder to Content folder of unpacked repo (skip existing files) - only ask this as I added test my to FrontEnd menu, in Content/System
do the same for City Sample, just copy content of Content folder and either overwrite if asked or ignore, i think there is only some audio mix common


should be able to run Lyra.uproject now and test map in FrontEnd/ Start Game/ Lyracity
or play test Small_City_LVL or Big_City_LVL, dont forget to add LyraPlayerStart to your map and set gamemode to LyraGamemode
